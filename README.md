WPT Test Runner
===============

NodeJS test runner for web-platform-test testharness tests.

Usage
-----

```
npx wpt-test [FLAGS] TEST_DIR
```

wpt-test will use web-driver to run all of the tests found in `TEST_DIR` in a
browser and report their results. Tests must be HTML file containing
TestHarness.js test cases.

By default, tests will run against a temporary local server in Chrome. You can
customize the target run environment with the `--browser` flag.
